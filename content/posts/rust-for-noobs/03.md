A complete guide to get started with Rust - Part 3

<!--more-->

In Part - 2 of this guide, we saw how to create variables, make them mutable, and then mutate them. We also saw how shadowing works in Rust. In this part we'll look at function definitions and how to call them.

## Functions
In the first part, I showed you how a function is declared. To declare a function, we use the `fn` keyword, followed by the function name and a pair of brackets inside which we can pass arguments. At the end, we also need to add a pair of curly braces inside which we'll define the code that needs to run when the function is called.

Let's write a function to find the area of a rectangle given its length and breadth. First we'll create a function named `get_area` like this:
```
fn get_area() {
    // get  area
}
```

Now we know that the area of a rectangle is `l x b` where `l` is the length and `b` is the breadth. Lets implement this in our code. Modify it like so:
```
fn get_area() {
    let l = 14;
    let b = 6;
    let area = l * b;
    println!("{}", area);
}
```
Now if we run our code, it won't print anything. That's 'cause we haven't called this function, we've only defined it. To call it, we can just put the function name and then pair of brackets. So lets call this function from our `main` function like this:
```
fn main() {
    get_area();
}
```

Now if we
