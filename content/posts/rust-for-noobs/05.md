A complete guide to get started with Rust - Part 5

<!--more-->

In this part, we're going to look at how we can structure our Rust project.

## Project Structure
Currently the structure of our project looks like this:
```text
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
   └── main.rs
```
We have our `main` function all the rest of the functions in the `main.rs` file. In a real world project, you would never do this. You'd place different functions in files. This makes it easier to manage a project and also reduces the clutter of our code. Let's see how we can do this in Rust.

First, we'll create a file named `functions.rs` next to our `main.rs` file. Next, we'll copy the `get_area` function, which we created in part - 3. Now `functions.rs` looks like this:
```rust
fn get_area(length: i32, breadth: i32) -> i32 {
    length * breadth
}
```
If you try compiling our code, it won't compile. It'll give this error:
```text
 --> src/main.rs:2:13
  |
2 |     let area = get_area(14, 6);
  |                ^^^^^^^^ not found in this scope
```
That's because we have imported this function. In C/C++, you'd use `#include` to import it. Well, we can do something similar in Rust, using the `use` keyword. We can import the entire file or just a specific function, like this:
```
use functions::get_area;
```
This should work right? Well, not quite. Yes, we are importing the function, but Rust doesn't know what `functions` is or what it points to. To tell the Rust compiler to look into the `functions.rs` file, we need to define it as a **module**. We can do that using the `mod` keyword. Put this line before the `use` statement:
```rust
mod functions;
```
