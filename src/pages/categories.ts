    desc: "This series dives into **Embedded Rust**, leveraging `no_std` to write bare-metal firmware for the **STM32 Blue Pill**. It covers **setting up the development environment**, flashing code onto the board, and understanding low-level microcontroller operation. We’ll navigate **register-level programming**, work with **sensors, servos, and peripherals**, and generate **PWM signals** for precise control. If you’re into **low-level performance, deterministic systems, and real-time applications**, this is where Rust meets raw silicon—no OS, no hand-holding, just embedded engineering done right.",
