    desc: "This series dives into <strong>Embedded Rust</strong>, leveraging <code>no_std</code> to write bare-metal firmware for the <strong>STM32 Blue Pill</strong>. It covers <strong>setting up the development environment</strong>, flashing code onto the board, and understanding low-level microcontroller operation. We’ll navigate <strong>register-level programming</strong>, work with <strong>sensors, servos, and peripherals</strong>, and generate <strong>PWM signals</strong> for precise control. If you’re into <strong>low-level performance, deterministic systems, and real-time applications</strong>, this is where Rust meets raw silicon—no OS, no hand-holding, just embedded engineering done right.",
