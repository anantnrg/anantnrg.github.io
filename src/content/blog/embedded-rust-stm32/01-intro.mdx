In this tutorial, we'll see why **Rust** is a good choice for embedded programming, why <code>no_std</code> exists, and how we talk to the hardware without an OS using **Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)** and **Peripheral Access Crates (PACs).**

## Why Rust?

Before we start, this series assumes you have some basic Rust experience. If not, check out my other Rust tutorial series: [link here].

Now that thatâ€™s out of the way, why should we even consider Rust for embedded programming?
In fact, Rust's strengths in user-level apps also make it a killer choice for embedded programming:

  1. **Memory-safety**: On a PC, memory leaks are annoying. On a microcontroller tho? They're **fatal**! Rustâ€™s **borrow checker prevents** leaks without **garbage collection**, keeping performance tight for mission-critical systems.
  2. **Zero-cost abstractions**: Writing embedded code doesn't always have to be manual bit-fiddling. Rustâ€™s high-level features (**iterators, smart pointers**, etc.) add **zero overhead**, giving **Python-like readability** with **C-like performance**.
  3. **No data-races**: Concurrency in embedded systems is a minefield. In C/C++, forget a lock? **Boom!** â€” your system crashes. Rust enforces safety **at compile time**, so you **canâ€™t** mess it up.

Alright, now that you see Rust ain't just hype, its time to strip away the training wheels and go **full bare-metal**â€”say hello to `no_std` !

## What is `no_std` and why do we need it?

Rust, by default, provides a `std` library, which contains a TON of useful stuff. Some common features it provides include:
  1. **Heap Allocation** with types like `Vec`, `Box` and `String`
  2. **File I/O** with `std::fs`
  3. **Networking** using `std::net`
  4. **Threads & Concurrency** with `std::thread` and `std::sync`
  5. **Panic Handling** using `std::panic`
  6. **Printing** (heh!) with `println!`

**TL;DR:** `std` is a pretty feature-packed toolbox in Rust, but it assumes we got an OS, a heap, and a bunch of system resources to play with.

But on embedded systems, we ain't got **no OS**, **no heap** and **no threads**, so the standard library is just dead weight. Instead, we use `no_std`, which is like a stripped version of the standard library with only the very essentials. Think of `no_std` as skimmed milk as compared to whole milk (`std`).

Some of the things we lose include **heap allocation** (`Vec`, `Box`, or `String`), **file I/O**, **networking**, **threading**, and `println!` (nooo! ðŸ˜­)

But don't lose hope yet! We still have quite some fundamental stuff with the `core` crate. `core` is Rust's **minimal** stand library, with stuff like:
  1. `Option` and `Result` for error handling
  2. `str`, `slice`, `array`, `i8`-`i128`, `u8`-`u128`, `f32` & `f64` for storing useful data
  3. `format_args!`, `write!`, and `writeln!` for string formatting (but no `println!`)
  4. `#[panic_handler]` to define what happens on panic (like blinking an LED or resetting the chip)

Further, if we wanna use stuff we're familiar with like `Vec` and `String`, we can use the [`heapless` crate](https://github.com/rust-embedded/heapless) made specifically for embedded systems!

Alright, now we got the bare essentials with `no_std`, `core` and optionally `heapless`, but how we do actually *talk to the hardware?* We can't just throw Rust at a microcontroller and hope for the best! This is where **Peripheral Access Crates (PACs)** and **Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs)** come inâ€”they help us control the microcontroller without manually flipping bits in registers like a caveman!

## PACs and HALs

First let's talk about **Peripheral Access Crates**, the *low-level* stuff. PACs are **auto-generated** from the chip's **SVD file**, which is just a hardware description file, often provided by the chip's manufacturer. PACs give us **direct** access to the chip's **registers**, aka, the raw bits controlling the hardware. Using a PAC is safe thanks to Rust, but the code is still very **low-level** and **verbose**. However, since PACs are specific for each microcontroller, the code written for one microcontroller (e.g, the STM32F103) wont work for another microcontroller (e.g, the ATmega 2560).

This is where **Hardware Abstraction Layers** come into play, to make our lives a lot easier. HALs sit *on top* of PACs and provide a **simpler, high-level API** to interact with hardware. Instead of manually toggling registers, HALs offer **safe, ergonomic methods**. They are also very portable, since they abstract different chips and lets us write code that works across multiple devices.

These differences will become more apparent once we start actually programming microcontrollers.

### The End!

That's it for this tutorial!!! In the next one, we'll setup a Windows PC to program and upload code to a STM32 Bluepill board. `:wq`
