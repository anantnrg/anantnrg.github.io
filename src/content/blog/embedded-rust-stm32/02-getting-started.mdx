In the last tutorial in this series, we looked at embedded programming in Rust and `no-std`. In this tutorial, we'll see how to set up a Windows PC to program an STM32 Bluepill Board using the STLink V2 programmer.

## The Hardware

We'll be using an STM32 Bluepill board, a pretty cool 32-bit microcontroller break out board. The heart of this board is the **STM32F103**, which is based on the **ARM Cortex-M3** architecture. It has around **20KB RAM** and **64KB Flash ROM** (128KB on some unoffical models). These tiny chips run at **72MHz**, *much, much* faster than the ATmega 328p microcontrollers we're used to.

One thing to note is that while Arduino boards (such as the Uno or the Mega) have **5.0V I/O**, the STM boards have **3.3V I/O**.
If we connect a 5V peripheral like a sensor or a servo directly to one of these pins, there's a good chance you'll fry your board! To prevent this, we use a neat little device called a **Logic-Level Converter/Shifter**.

       caption="The one pictured above is a 4-channel level shifter, meaning it can be used with 4 I/O peripherals!" />

These convert the 3.3V signals from the STM32 to 5V signals for the peripheral, and 5V signals from the peripherals to 3.3V signals for the STM32.
