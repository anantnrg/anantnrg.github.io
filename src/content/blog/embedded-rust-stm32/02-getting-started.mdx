In the last tutorial in this series, we looked at embedded programming in Rust and `no-std`. In this tutorial, we'll see how to setup a Windows PC to program a STM32 Bluepill Board using the STLink V2 programmer.

## The Hardware

We'll be using a STM32 Bluepill board, a pretty cool 32-bit microcontroller break out board. The heart of this board is the **STM32F103** or its close variants. It has around **20KB RAM** and **64KB Flash ROM**.
